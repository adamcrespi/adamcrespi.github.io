<p>
I'm currently conducting research under Prof. <a href="https://mech.ubc.ca/dominic-liao-mcpherson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominic Liao-McPherson</a> at UBC, focused on developing real-time, adaptive control strategies for multi-agent systems. The work combines concepts from static equilibrium analysis, optimization, and game theory to simulate and solve competitive multi-agent interactions.
</p>

<h4>Project Overview</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Built a symbolic solver using Python (Sympy) to compute static equilibria in constrained systems</li>
  <li>Implemented a multi-agent simulator to find and analyze Nash equilibria</li>
  <li>Applied KKT conditions to characterize optimal strategies under shared constraints</li>
  <li>Validated models using known analytical solutions to ensure correctness</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tools & Skills</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Python (Sympy, NumPy)</li>
  <li>Optimization theory, game theory, and equilibrium modeling</li>
  <li>GitHub for version control and structured development workflow</li>
</ul>

<p>
This project will be developed full-time during Summer 2025, with a final deliverable including a simulation framework, full technical report, and visualization of agent dynamics under varying constraints.
