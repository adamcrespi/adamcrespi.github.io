<h2>Embedded Software Intern — Middleware Platform</h2>
<h3>Rivian / RV-Tech · May 2025 – December 2025</h3>

<p>
  I spent eight months on Rivian's embedded middleware / platform team working on firmware that
  sits between vehicle applications and the underlying microcontrollers, peripherals, and networks.
</p>

<h3>What I Worked On</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Solo brought up a new <strong>Bazel-based build + test target</strong> and integrated it with
    Ethernet and UDS infrastructure to run 30+ automated HIL tests for the NVM library.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used those tests to uncover <strong>wear-leveling issues in flash NVM</strong>, driving changes
    that significantly improved endurance and robustness.
  </li>
  <li>
    Debugged a high-priority issue in the <strong>Ethernet stack</strong> (ARP table fall-through)
    that could drop comms, and contributed a production fix plus a regression test.
  </li>
  <li>
    20++ tickets more....
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Embedded & RTOS:</strong> bare-metal C, RTOS-style patterns, DMA, interrupts, non-volatile memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Networking:</strong> basic Ethernet/ARP/TCP diagnostics, packet capture and analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> Bazel, HIL test automation, JTAG / on-target debugging workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> code reviews, design discussions, and working in an agile developement environment.</li>
</ul>
