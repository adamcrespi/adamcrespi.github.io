<h3>May 2025 â€“ December 2025</h3>

<p>
I'm incredibly excited to be spending my co-op term at <strong>Rivian</strong> on the Embedded Platform Team! It's been a fantastic opportunity to deepen my skills in low-level firmware development while contributing to real vehicle systems.
</p>

<p>
During my time here, I've worked on platform-agnostic firmware modules to support scalable peripheral integration, improved internal tools for non-volatile memory management, and built automation pipelines to support validation efforts across HIL and bench testing.
