  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The <b>CPU-Accelerated Arbitrage Research Platform (CARP)</b> is our capstone project focused on real-time blockchain data analysis and on-chain market research. 
    Developed by our three-person team, CARP provides a controlled environment for studying decentralized exchange dynamics — specifically how small pricing inconsistencies emerge and evolve across different marketplaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than depending on external APIs or black-box data providers, CARP interacts directly with the blockchain through a self-hosted node and a lightweight indexing layer. 
    This setup allows us to explore the structure, latency, and efficiency of decentralized finance networks using only local data.
